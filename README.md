# Database Application - Assignment Semeter 2 2019 at RMIT

## Facebook Lite

I was asked to write a PHP application with a MongoDB backend to do the following tasks: 

- Create a new facebook-lite account, log into your current account
- Manage account
- Invite a friend (among current users) and accept (or reject) friend requests you receive
- Add a post
- Add a Like to other posts
- Add a response to other posts
- Display your Facebook page rendered in a user-friendly and accessible manner


The main pages for this application are: 

- Application homepage
- New User Creation page
- Main page
- Account Profile Maintenance page
